# ALIS---Artificial-Learning-Intelligent-Soloist

ALIS is a program based on LSTM RNNs with the primary aim of generating guitar solos and guitar licks to help with the creative process of writing solos for songs.

With the intent of the program being available to as many musicians as possible without damaging hardware, the whole program is split into two main parts; the Master and the User.

# The Master (ALIS_Master branch):

The Master is the part of the program used to create text training data from cleaned MIDI files as well as trained models.

# The User

The User is the part of the program which can be used to generate guitar solos based on the trained models made by the Master.
